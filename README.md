##  Healthcare Accessibility Prediction

This project explores how improved **access to healthcare** can significantly reduce **death cases** in Nigeria. Through data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling, we highlight the potential impact of our proposed healthcare-access mobile application.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to **predict the reduction in death cases** that could result from increased accessibility to healthcare services, made possible through a proposed **mobile application** that connects patients directly with medical professionals.

---

##  Tools & Technologies

* **Excel** – for data gathering and initial preprocessing
* **Jupyter Notebook** – for data cleaning, exploration, and predictive analysis
* **Power BI** – for interactive data visualization
* **Python (Linear Regression)** – to build a predictive model that estimates the effect of increased accessibility
* **.ipynb file** – contains the entire notebook workflow
* **.pbix file** – contains the Power BI dashboard

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

Data was collected and compiled using **Excel**, focusing on:

* Number of hospitals per region
* Population density
* Distance to healthcare facilities
* Reported death cases
* Accessibility rating

---

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and formatted in Excel and Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted in Python to find trends and correlations.
3. **Prediction Model**: A **Linear Regression** model was built to estimate the reduction in death cases with improved access.
4. **Visualization**: Power BI dashboards were created to present the insights clearly and interactively.

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

* A **strong negative correlation** was found between healthcare accessibility and death rates.
* The **Linear Regression model** predicts that **increased accessibility** could significantly reduce death cases across various regions.
* Power BI visualizations clearly illustrate the gap between regions and the potential impact of bridging this gap through technology.

---

## 📲 The Solution

We propose a mobile app that:

* **Connects patients to doctors, nurses, and healthcare facilities**
* Enables **remote consultations**
* Helps users **locate the nearest healthcare providers**
* Supports **emergency response** features

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Enhancing access to healthcare through technology can lead to measurable reductions in mortality. This project offers data-driven evidence supporting the development and deployment of our healthcare-access app as a **life-saving intervention**.
