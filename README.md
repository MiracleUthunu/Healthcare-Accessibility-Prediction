Healthcare Accessibility Prediction
This project aims to predict the potential reduction in death cases with increased accessibility to healthcare through the introduction of our app, which connects patients to medical professionals.
Introduction
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the impact of improved healthcare accessibility on reducing death cases. Our app connects patients with doctors and medical professionals, making healthcare more accessible.

Data Collection
The data used in this project was collected using Excel. It includes various factors influencing healthcare accessibility and corresponding death cases.

Methodology
We utilized the following tools and techniques for our analysis:

Excel: For data gathering and initial preprocessing.
Jupyter Notebook: For data analysis and prediction.
Power BI: For data visualization.
Linear Regression: For predicting the potential reduction in death cases.
Visualization
Visualizations were created using Power BI to illustrate the relationship between healthcare accessibility and death cases.

Results
The linear regression model indicates a significant potential reduction in death cases with increased accessibility to healthcare services facilitated by our app.

Conclusion
Our findings suggest that enhancing healthcare accessibility through our app can lead to a notable decrease in death cases. This underscores the importance of integrating technology into healthcare to save lives.
